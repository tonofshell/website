      <description>I am an aspiring data scientist, currently pursuing a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Computational Social Science at the University of Chicago. My interests are grounded in the social forces that separate us, and how these rifts in society can contribute to inequality. Currently I am focusing on dimensions such as race and socioeconomic class and their influence on geospatial segregation. I have a BA in Sociology from the University of Massachusetts - Amherst, where most notably, I studied the growing religious divide as it pertains to college students.</description>
