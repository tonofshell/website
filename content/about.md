title: About
---

I am an aspiring data scientist, currently pursuing a Master's in Computational Social Science at the University of Chicago. My interests are grounded in the social forces that separate us, and how these rifts in society can contribute to inequality. Currently I am focusing on dimensions such as race and socioeconomic class and their influence on geospatial segregation. I have a BA in Sociology from the University of Massachusetts - Amherst, where most notably, I studied the growing religious divide as it pertains to college students.

While I have listed some of my most recent projects below, you can also [view my current work on GitHub](http://github.com/tonofshell), [connect with me on LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/tonofshell), or [contact me directly](http://m.me/tonofshell) as well. The code for this website is [publicly available on GitHub](https://github.com/tonofshell/website). The [Hugo theme](https://github.com/tonofshell/github-dev-page) used for the site is based off the [Github Landing Page theme](https://github.com/nsomar/github-project-landing-page) by [nsomar](https://github.com/nsomar/).
